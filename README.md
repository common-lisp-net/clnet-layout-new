Repository for development of clnet's new web design

# Description

This is currently one webpage with non-functioning links to demonstrate the new design I'm proposing for clnet.

It is written with sbcl on top of Hunchentoot.

# Instructions

Run sbcl from the main directory and load "runserver.lisp": 

```
(load "runserver.lisp")
```

Now you should be able to view the website at: 

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
